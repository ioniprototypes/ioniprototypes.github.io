The significance and importance of data cannot be understated however only when its connected with peoples’ informed understanding, consent and truely framed to exploit new technologies, can the real transforming benefits emerge. But this is hard, and while lots of focus is on API’s, Machine Learning, Public Cloud innovation etc., there is less focus on what is the actual data, how is it structured, how is it described and linked, how can it be created and risks be managed  etc. Data Studio can help.
